# Material Design Template for DokuWiki

This Material template is very easy to install and use, whilst offering a multitude of customization options.
Foremost, you can choose a primary (and primary dark) and accent color. From there on, you can fully customize the sidebar, making use of the entire material icon pack.

Visit the template page on the [DokuWiki forums](https://www.dokuwiki.org/template:material)

It is based off [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/) with some minor changes and adjustements.
